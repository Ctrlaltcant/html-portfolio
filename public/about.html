<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm honestly just starting this. I don't know what you want me to say.</p>

<p>Maybe a bit about yourself, Jess.<br/>
Oh, okay.<br/>
Well. I'm an artist, a life enthusiastic and a true believer of never bothering people for their lifestyle. I'm also a writer of
fanfictions and, occasionally, original stuff. It's very important to say that whoever talks to me must be ready to listen to a 
lot (LOT LOT LOT) of stuff about my future wife, because she's my main inspiration, best friend and lover.<br/>
I think that's it?<br/>
Oh wait, I'm also an holistic therapist. That's important to know when to approach me (especially if i start talking metaphors).</p>

<p>Bye? What are you doing still here? Breathe some fresh air my friend and close this boring page.</p>
